## Sample Angular application
The application is built on angular 13.2.5 and node 16
It does not take any production related optimizations into account, 
the starter is intended to be simply cloned and deployed.
Doing a npm run build in the front end folder should setup up the 
angular application, with an image (to show asset path ) and with a
working route (hello world ) implemented in a component
